    "\n",
    "SQLAlchemy provides the ability to specify a [\"joined load\" option](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_1/orm/tutorial.html#joined-load).  Passing a [orm.joinedload()](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_1/orm/loading_relationships.html#sqlalchemy.orm.joinedload) to [Query.options()](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_1/orm/query.html#sqlalchemy.orm.query.Query.options) will emit a left join operation by default.  So you need to set `innerjoin=True` if required.  Data can then be eager-loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we will extend our query to only \"join-load\" the `User` model.  Subsequent accesses to the `user` property in a `Submission` instance will not emit `SELECT` queries.  But note that joined-loads will load all columns in the related model.  This is fine for the `User` model because it has relatively few columns which are expected to be short strings (first and last name).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we don't do this for `models.Form`.  This is conscious decision as the `Form.schema` column is a JSON field which, relative to other columns, can be quite large.  SQLAlchemy will continue to use its default lazy loading behavior and load the form using separate `SELECT` queries when `form` property of a `Submission` instance.  This may actually be fine for relatively few forms because their schemas will remain in the `Session` cache after loading and thus potentially avoiding repeated `SELECT` queries."

This does require a bit more code but is possible using [explicit joins and eager loads](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_1/orm/tutorial.html#explicit-join-eagerload).  This provides full control and avoids relying on lazy-loading or `Session` cache behavior.\n",

    "* Chain call [Query.join()](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_1/orm/query.html#sqlalchemy.orm.query.Query.join) for each *model* you wish to eager load via a `INNER JOIN`\n",
    "* Pass to to [Query.options()](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_1/orm/query.html#sqlalchemy.orm.query.Query.options) a [orm.contains_eager()](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_1/orm/loading_relationships.html#sqlalchemy.orm.contains_eager) for each *related property* you wish to eager-load\n",
    "* To restrict to only a subset of columns, extend your eager option by chaining to [orm.load_only()](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_1/orm/loading_columns.html?highlight=load_only#sqlalchemy.orm.load_only) with the column attribute string you want to restrict it to.\n",

    "The resulting query gives us precise control.  Note that the primary keys (`id` columns) are still loaded as part of the join which is default behavior in SQLAlchemy.  This is acceptable as our primary aim was to avoid loading the largest column (`schema`)."
